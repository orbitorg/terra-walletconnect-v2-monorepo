## Setup development

The following dependencies are required for relay server:

- git
- make
- docker

To setup the local redis and relay server you can run:

```sh
make dev
```

## Test Client

Client unit tests can be run against: local (`make dev`), staging, and production server

```sh
# local (dev)
make test-client

# staging server
make test-staging

# production server
make test-production
```
